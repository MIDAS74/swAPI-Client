# Star Wars API Client Application
## main
This is a basic console app that queries the Star Wars API hosted by Pipedream, 
initial scope is to be able to input a range in megalights (decimal user input), 
query the API for summarised data on all starships, full data on individual ships and return how many pitstops are required
for each to reach their destination. 

## usage
TODO - add usage instructions

## tech notes
This uses Spectre.Console 0.49.1 to format and constrain user input, 
has lovely parts for validating user input before attempting to execute with it
